1. Intro                                                        *breeze-intro*

Breeze is little plugin that provides a handful of EasyMotion-like HTML
motions.

NOTE: Breeze has changed! Since version 2.0 Breeze has undergone significant
changes. While some features like tag matching and dom navigation have been
removed, the jumping functionality have been strengthened. If you liked real
time tag matching I suggest you to try `github.com/Valloric/MatchTagAlways`,
it seems to work much better.


==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                        *breeze-usage*

Breeze does not define any mappings for you, you have to map Breeze motions
by yourself. Below an example of how you can set you own mappings:
>
    " jump to all visible opening tags after the cursor position
    nmap <leader>j <Plug>(breeze-jump-tag-forward)

    " jump to all visible opening tags before the cursor position
    nmap <leader>J <Plug>(breeze-jump-tag-backward)

    " jump to all visible HTML attributes after the cursor position
    nmap <leader>a <Plug>(breeze-jump-attribute-forward)

    " jump to all visible HTML attributes before the cursor position
    nmap <leader>A <Plug>(breeze-jump-attribute-backward)
<
After triggering one of the mappings above, Breeze will ask you for where
you want to jump to. To abort the whole process press either `<ESC>` or `CTRL+C`.

This is all you have to know to start jumping around your HTML files. Just
remember that once you have jumped somewhere you can easily move back to the
previous position with `CTRL+O` (`:h CTRL+O`).
